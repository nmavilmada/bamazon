# bamazon

This is an Amazon-like storefront built with MySQL and Node.js. 

In the customer portal
1. You can view the inventory
2. Choose an item you'd like to purchase using the Item ID
3. Enter the quanity 

If the quanity requested by customer is in stock, then the sale would go through and produce the tranaction total and give the customer option to purchase more items.

If the Answer is "YES", it will show the inventory again with the updated quantities from the last transaction. If the answer is "NO", then the message "Thank you for shopping, Have a nice day" will display.

If an item is out of stock or not enough items are in stock then it will display
"Sorry, there's only x amount  available in  stock".
